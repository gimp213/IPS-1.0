//the password is 1233, but it's not.
password=input("Enter your password: ")
//put Google Chromium in the box "execute=input"
print("What you want to execute?")
execute=input("")
//put How to make a good apple pie? in "search=input"
print("Welcome to the Google Chromium! What do you want to search?")
search=input("")
print("If you want to make a good apple pie, you need good hands and the recipe of a apple pie, then you make a good apple pie.")
//in "idle=input", press enter or put ok.
idle=input("")
//in "search=input" put exit.
print("What you want to search?")
search=input("")
//in "execute=input" put "Shut Down".
print("What you want to Execute?")
execute=input("")
//in "enter=input", press enter.
